We build robust State-of-Health (SoH) prediction models for lithium-ion batteries using a complete data engineering and ML pipeline, including feature extraction, PCC-based selection, and hybrid deep learning.
Our approach integrates CNN-Transformer architectures with traditional models like ExtraTrees to achieve accurate, generalizable SoH and RUL estimation across diverse NASA battery datasets.
This repository reflects the collaborative work of a three-member team focused on scalable, physics-aware, and data-driven battery health analytics
